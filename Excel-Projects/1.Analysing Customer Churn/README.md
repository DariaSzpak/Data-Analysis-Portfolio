# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Analysis â€“ Guided DataCamp Excel Project

## Project Overview
This is a beginner-friendly exploratory data analysis project focused on understanding why customers are churning at a fictitious telecom company. The project was originally completed as part of a **DataCamp Excel course**. The main task was to identify key patterns and customer behaviours associated with churn using various Excel tools.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables and Calculated Fields
- Charts and Data Visualisation
- Conditional Formatting
- Logical Formulas (IF, AND, Nested IF)

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of fictional customer data from a telecom provider, including:
- **Demographic Information**: Age, Gender, State
- **Account Details**: Length of subscription, Contract type, Charges
- **Service Usage**: Data usage, Premium plans, International usage
- **Churn**: Churn label and stated reasons

## Analysis Workflow

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicate records
- **Churn Rate Calculation**: Calculated churn percentages overall and across subgroups
- **Churn Reason Analysis**: Identified most common reasons customers cited for leaving
- **Demographic Insights**: Grouped customers by age brackets
- **Usage Patterns**: Analysed churn relative to data usage and plan types
- **International Activity**: Assessed churn in relation to international service use
- **Account Length**: Examined correlation between account duration and churn
- **Visualisation**: Built supporting charts and a dashboard to summarise key metrics

## Examples of Pivot Tables

## ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard
A summary dashboard was created to visualise the main findings.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- The **most common churn reason** was competitor-related: better offers, better devices, and dissatisfaction with support agents.
- **Senior customers** showed the **highest churn rates** â€” with the 79â€“88 age group having the greatest proportion of churners despite being the smallest demographic.
- **Unlimited data plan users** were more likely to churn, particularly those with **low data usage**.
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** had the **highest churn rate**.
- Churn tended to **decrease over time** â€” customers who had been with the company longer were more likely to stay.
- Certain **states with international plan users** had disproportionately high churn rates.

## What I Learned

- How to apply **pivot tables and calculated fields** to explore large datasets
- Use of **logical Excel formulas** (IF, AND, Nested IF) for conditional analysis
- Basic **data visualisation principles** in Excel
- How to interpret real-world business questions (like churn) through data
