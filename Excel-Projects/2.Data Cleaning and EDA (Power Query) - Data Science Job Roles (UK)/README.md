# ðŸ“‰ UK Data Science Job Roles - 2024

## Project Overview
This is a simple exploratory data analysis project using widely available data on data science job postings in the UK from 2024, sourced from Kaggle:

ðŸ”— Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emreksz/data-scientist-job-roles-in-uk/data

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate practical data cleaning and preprocessing skills using a combination of Power Query and Excel formulas, while preparing the dataset to answer key analytical questions about job trends and salaries in the data science field.

Questions:
- Which country has the highest and lowest average salary?
- Do remote jobs offer higher salaries compared to on-site roles?
- Which UK cities offer the highest and lowest paying roles on average?
- Which job categories are highest and lowest paying?
- What are the most common skills requested across all jobs?
- What are the top 10 companies in terms of average yearly salary?


## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Power Query
- Pivot Tables
- Charts and Data Visualisation
- Conditional Formatting


## Dataset Overview
This CSV file contains detailed information on data scientist job listings in UK sourced from Glassdoor. The dataset includes the following columns:

Company: Name of the hiring company.
Company Score: Average rating of the company on Glassdoor.
Job Title: Title of the job position.
Location: Job location.
Date: Date the job was posted or updated.
Salary: Estimated salary range for the position.
Skills:Skills required for the position

## Data Cleaning and Analysis Workflow

* Removed duplicate rows.
* Split the Location column into separate City and Country columns; cleaned and trimmed text.
* Standardised country names:
Midlothian â†’ Scotland, County Durham â†’ England, United Kingdom â†’ Unknown
* Created a new column â€˜Work Modeâ€™ (Remote vs Onsite) using Power Queryâ€™s Conditional Column.
* Replaced â€˜Remoteâ€™ with null in City and Country fields to prevent duplication or conflict.
* Cleaned the Salary column:
Removed special characters (K, text tags like "Glassdoor est.")
Removed hourly wage entries.
* Transformed salary ranges into single average values.
* Grouped job titles into broader categories (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Engineer, etc.) for better analysis.
* Added a new workbook where job skills were split into rows from a comma-separated column, enabling frequency analysis of requested skills across roles.
* Performed basic EAD using Pivot Rables to answer analytical questions
